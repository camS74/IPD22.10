# Globe Styling Issue Analysis

## 🔍 **Root Cause Identified**

The issue is that **react-globe.gl renders text as WebGL textures or canvas elements**, not DOM elements. This means:

- ❌ CSS styling won't work
- ❌ JavaScript DOM manipulation won't work  
- ❌ Traditional web styling approaches are ineffective

## 🧪 **Test Applied**

I've temporarily changed the text color to **RED (#ff0000)** to test if the `labelColor` prop is working at all.

## 📋 **What to Check Now**

1. **Open your 3D globe** in the browser
2. **Look for RED text** - if you see red country names, the `labelColor` prop works
3. **If you see RED text**: The issue is just that we need to use the correct props
4. **If you still see black text**: There's a deeper issue with the react-globe.gl implementation

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### If RED text appears:
- ✅ `labelColor` prop works
- ✅ We can style text through react-globe.gl props
- ✅ We just need to find the correct prop names for font family, size, etc.

### If text is still black:
- ❌ `labelColor` prop not working
- ❌ Need to investigate react-globe.gl configuration
- ❌ Possible version compatibility issue

## 🛠️ **Next Steps Based on Results**

### If RED text appears:
1. Change color back to white: `text: '#ffffff'`
2. Research react-globe.gl documentation for font styling props
3. Apply font family, size, weight through proper props
4. Remove all CSS/JavaScript styling attempts (they won't work)

### If text is still black:
1. Check react-globe.gl version compatibility
2. Look for alternative text rendering approaches
3. Consider using a different globe library
4. Investigate if labels are disabled or not rendering

## 📊 **Current Status**

- **CSS Approach**: ❌ Won't work (WebGL rendering)
- **JavaScript Approach**: ❌ Won't work (WebGL rendering)  
- **labelColor Prop**: 🧪 Testing with RED color
- **Other Props**: ❓ Need to research correct prop names

## 💡 **Key Insight**

React-globe.gl uses WebGL for rendering, which means:
- Text is rendered as textures on the 3D surface
- Traditional web styling (CSS/JS) doesn't apply
- Styling must be done through library-specific props
- Performance is better but styling is more limited
