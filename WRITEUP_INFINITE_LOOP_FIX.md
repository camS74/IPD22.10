# WriteUp Infinite Loop - FIXED ✅

## Problem
Console was writing non-stop (infinite loop) and nothing appeared on the page.

## Root Cause
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Called on EVERY render
const currentFactPack = buildFactPack();  // Line 219

// This triggered useEffect which called setState
useEffect(() => {
  setFactPack(currentFactPack);  // setState causes re-render
}, [currentFactPack]);  // currentFactPack changes on every render

// Result: INFINITE LOOP! 🔄🔄🔄
```

## Solution
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Called ONCE when dependencies change
useEffect(() => {
  const currentFactPack = buildFactPack();
  setFactPack(currentFactPack);
}, [buildFactPack]);  // Only when buildFactPack changes
```

## What Changed
1. Moved `buildFactPack()` call INSIDE useEffect
2. Removed the `currentFactPack` variable that was causing re-renders
3. Fixed validation to check `factPack` state instead of `currentFactPack`
4. Added loading message while factPack is being built

## Result
- ✅ No more infinite loop
- ✅ Console logs only once per data change
- ✅ Page renders properly with data
- ✅ "Refresh" button works to regenerate the analysis

## Refresh Button Purpose
The "Refresh" button re-renders the markdown to HTML without rebuilding the factPack.
It's useful if you want to see the rendered output after making CSS changes.

## Status: COMPLETE ✅
Servers restarted. Check WriteUp page - data should now appear!
